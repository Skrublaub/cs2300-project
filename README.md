# Overview

CS 2300 has a semester long database project. This is the implementation of it in postgres.
There is a front end, a back end, a database for this project, and the community version
of cloudbeaver for us to use. This is all related
to DND, and there will be features to look up player, class, spell, and monster
information.

The backend API is fully implemented with search and other features in the *backend* folder.

## Problems
The backend does not work inside of the docker container. For the presentation, we
set it up outside of the container, and it worked fine.

The frontend was rushed. We didn't have time to implement all of the features
we wanted to inside of it.

## Other

The database data can be found at this onion link (no data yet):
